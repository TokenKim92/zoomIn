# ZoomIn

A Program using C++ to zoom window and select pixel color.

It is useful for looking at the details of the little icons and choosing a color from them.

This Program was inspired by Programmer `Soungyub Kim`.

The website he runs is under this link: https://cafe.naver.com/mythread

## How to run

Download as zip or clone the repository and run ZoomIn.exe. That's it!

Because it is an executable file, there are cases in `Edge` cannot download it when downloading with Zip.

In this case, download it from `Chrome`.

## How to use

If you hold down the `Shift key` and `move the mouse`, the position where the mouse is located is drawn larger.

And when you `click on a pixel` in the application, this pixel color value will appear in the button below. To copy this color value you should just `click the button`.

You can select the zoom size ratio via `the mouse wheel`.

## Used tools

- C++
